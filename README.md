with variables configuration = (here `app` is the tag key value to filter)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd2a9ed-35a1-4e34-ac36-e75e075fe4c3)
```
fetch dt.entity.process_group
| expand  tags
| filter matchesPhrase(tags,"app")
| dedup tags
| fields tags
```

Sample 2) segment based on namespace

with variables configuration =  
```
fetch dt.entity.host_group
